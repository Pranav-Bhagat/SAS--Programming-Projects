Both of these two observations have total prices over $100.
This is because the bundles include more games besides
mario kart.

We do not have balanced data. However, we're doing a 
one-way ANOVA so it is okay to use PROC ANOVA.

*
The p-value for ANOVA is below .05 Therefore, reject the null and conclude there is at least
one difference among the population average total prices
of the different number of wheels included.
The multiple comparisons showed there to be significant
differences between all of the groups.

We have independent observations and large sample sizes

The duration appears to have the strongest linear association
with totalPr with the correlation would be -.37416.

*
The observations are independent and the data has a linear pattern.
The constant variance assumption is not satisfied, but the normality
of the residuals is good. We could see this using the diagnostic plots in
the PROC REG output.

I used the adjusted R-square as the selection criteria. The best 
model, including the Adjusted R-square value of
0.7683, had the following variables: duration nBids startPr sellerRate wheels condI.
