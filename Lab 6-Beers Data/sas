The mean oz 13.6 and the median oz is 12.
Typically, the size of a craft beer is about 12 oz.

*
Around half of the craft beers have an abv less than 5.5%.
This is similar to lighter beers. The mean abv is approximately 6%, 
which is slightly above the lighter beers.

* The brewery with the greatest number of craft beers is
Brewery Vivant (62). A large portion of the breweries produce only 1 craft
beer like the Borderlands Brewing Company.

Portside Brewery is the highest average abv with 9.9%

Uncommon Brewers is the lowest overall abv with 0.1%

run;
*
It seems like IPAs tend to have higher abv than Ales. Ales
tend to have higher abv than Lagers. There doesn't seem to be
noticeable differences in the recommended sizes.
It looks like the Ales make up the largest portion of craft beers.
