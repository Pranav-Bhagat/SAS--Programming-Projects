*a);
proc ttest data = ss.lead alpha = .05 sides = 2;
paired Ld72*Ld73;
run;

*
This is a paired t-test for comparing population average
lead blood concentration between 1972 and 1973.
The p-value is .05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis
and conclude the population average of the lead blood concentration is
different between 1972 and 1973. The average level
is lower in 1973 compared to 1972.
*

*b);
proc ttest data = ss.lead alpha = .05 H0 = 5 sides = U;
var Ld73;
run;

*
This is a upper-tailed one-sided t-test for the population of the average
lead blood level in 1973 being above 5 micrograms per 100 mL.
The p-value is below .05 and so we reject the null hypothesis.
We conclude that the population average in 1973 is more than the safe limit
of 5 micrograms per 100 mL.
*

*c);
proc corr data = ss.lead;
var Iqv;
with Iqp;
run;

*
The correlation between verbal IQ and performance IQ is around .57.
There is a positive linear relationship between them.
*

*d);
proc ttest data = ss.lead alpha = .05 sides = 2;
var FWT_l;
class Group;
run;

*
This is a two-sided two-sample independent t-test which compares the population
average left hand finger wrist tapping ability across the two groups. 
The p-value is above .05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
We cannot conclude there is a difference between
the average left hand finger wrist tapping ability across
both the groups.

*
Based on the 3 variables tested, FWT_r had a significant difference
across the two groups.
